{\bf APPLICATION DESCRIPTION}
\bigskip
\\This very simple application interface has been developed in Python is a game for the blind, this game is a story where the player is putting together the story at your convenience. The game is a fugitive who must take several decisions in the course of the game, which could be good or bad decisions, take these decisions could jeopardize his life, only to be driven keys run the game because it is a game for the blind.
\bigskip
\bigskip

{\bf APPLICATION FUNCTIONALITY}
\bigskip
\\1. This application is a game, which is to guide an inmate on a path that will lead to his freedom.\\

2. Just run the application will begin playing sounds.\\

3. It displays an image corresponding to the logo of the game, which is called SCAPE PLAN.\\

4. As they played the sounds the player has the option of choosing alternatives to the defendant, who must decide which sees fit to meet the goal.\\

\bigskip
\bigskip

{\bf WHO SHOULD THE APPLICATION}
\bigskip
\\The application has been implemented for the blind, which have developed their senses of touch and hearing, through which they can interact with the game and help to exercise each of the senses such as touch and hearing.
\bigskip
\bigskip
\newpage
{\bf COMMENTS}
\bigskip
\\Develop Python first requires patience, knowledge of C language, be very careful and pay attention on the indentations of the lines of code, as it can generate errors when running the application. Also check out the correct syntax of the functions and preserve the structure and skeleton of the app where you must define the functionality that is required to implement. 
\bigskip
\bigskip


{\bf CONCLUSIONES}
\bigskip
\\In this project we learned to program under Seller pygame python, this library helped in the implementation of the sounds as the game was for people with visual disabilities which were only to tell the story this way the blind person gradually assemble the story of the game until you reach its end\\
\\Benefited greatly Castilian documentation thus facilitated the use of the main features of language and allowed a better understanding of game logic.\\
\bigskip
\bigskip

{\bf EXPERIENCES}
\bigskip
\\Learning a new language that meets the expectations that one has as a junior programmer was a success to be able to study. In Python everything behaves in a very logic which provides a better implementation of the program, in addition to being a language that is interpreted code indentation, this used to write in a more elegant and clear.\\
\\Python information on the web is very varied and there are tutorials in several languages​​, the Python community is very large and
always willing to lend a hand or give new solutions to different problems.\\
\\The only downside is that because of dynamic typing, can bring bad habits to change type variables in a program, then in statically typed languages ​​bring problems.
